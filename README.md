### Hello world ðŸ‘‹ I'm Wahome âœ¨

Always trying (not necessarily succeeding) to do the right thing, often overextending myself, I'm a curious person who delights in working out the building blocks of the world, and rearranging them to build something even better. 

I'm a polyglot software engineer who has certainly made a lot of mistakes but learnt from them to become experienced. Indeed good judgement comes from experience, and experience from bad judgement. 

My career is developing software, but my life is adventuring. I love nothing more than a good challenge, having fun while at it. I live for good humour and banter..

Iâ€™m currently helping deliver office intelligence with the Microsoft Search, Assistance, and Intelligence team.
